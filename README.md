# Alexa-Smart-Speaker

A modern Smart-speaker with an advanced microphone array, camera module interfaced with Pi capable of performing AI-based tasks  

This Smart Speaker is capable of performing Facial Recognition used for Biometrics based Speaker System wakeup in addition to calling out the Alexa wake-word.  It also performs other Computer Vision based applications such as implementation of a camera-based security system. The Microphone array used to capture user’s voice has inbuilt Digital Signal Processing based voice algorithms which enables better capturing and understanding of user’s speech resulting in a successful full-duplex human-machine speech interaction
